## 📚 Problems Solved

### 1. Count Negative Numbers
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Arrays & Iteration

**Problem Statement:**  
Given an array of integers, count and return the total number of negative numbers in the array.

**Example:**
```
Input: [2, 3, -1, -5, -6, 7, -8, -4, 9]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 negative numbers: -1, -5, -6, -8, -4
```

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Python: `python/count-negative/count-negative.py`
- ✅ Go: `golang/count-negative/main.go`

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 2. Search Element
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Arrays & Searching

**Problem Statement:**  
Given an array of integers and a target element, find and return the index of the target element in the array. If the element is not found, return -1.

**Example:**
```
Input: arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 7, 10, 9, 5], x = 10
Output: 5
Explanation: Element 10 is found at index 5
```

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Python: `python/search-element/search-element.py`
- ✅ Go: `golang/search-element/main.go`

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
